## What is Poter?

Fission is a fast, open source serverless framework for Kubernetes with a focus on developer productivity and high performance.

Fission operates on _just the code_: Docker and Kubernetes are abstracted away under normal operation, though you can use both to extend Fission if you want to.

Fission is extensible to any language; the core is written in Go, and language-specific parts are isolated in something called _environments_ (more below).
Fission currently supports NodeJS, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, Bash, and any Linux executable, with more languages coming soon.
